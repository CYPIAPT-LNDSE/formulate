# Formulate!

Formulate is a tool created by [@gabrielperales](https://github.com/gabrielperales), [@mcelearr](https://github.com/mcelearr) and [@TroyMaeder](https://github.com/TroyMaeder) for the Anna Freud Centre, a child mental health research, training and treatment centre based in London.

## The problem

Formulation is a process that clinicians carry out when diagnosing patients. It is a methodical way of considering the patient's symptoms and drawing causal links to factors that the clinician suspects might be responsible. In this way, the clinician is able to come to a rational conclusion on the cause of the patients issues and how to go about treating them. However, these formulations are done on paper meaning they are hard to get access to and can be hard to decypher for other clinicians and the patients themselves.

## The solution

Formulate is a graphical representation of the folumation broken down into symptoms, causal factors and treatments. It benefits:
* The clinicians developing the formulations because they can see these connections more clearly.
* Other clinicians such as those who are picking up the case or carrying out peer review to more easily and quickly see what the original clinician was thinking when they made the diagnosis.
* The patient. By being able to see a visual represenation of their condition, patients may find their condition less intimidating and may gain a sense of control and empowerment.
